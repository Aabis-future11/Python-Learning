#empty set is a  dictionary
#sets are unordered and have no index values for accessing elements
#prints the same integer
#randomn values in set are saved in memory using hash
#hashing of numbers may show number itself for small numbers
# for loop iterates on a new sorted list when we use sorted(set_name)
#>this is the reason why it returns ordered values 
#keys are index for accessing values in a dictionary
